### When is it best to use if-else and when to use the switch?
### What use is the @Override before the toString method?
I know that toString is used to override the output that comes out when you print out the object, bu why is it best to use that "@Override"?
### Why the do-while loop keeps repeating the ""else if" after I typed 0 if i didn't add the "sc.nextLine();"?
